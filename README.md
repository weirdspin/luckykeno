# Lucky Keno

[**Live Demo**](https://weirdspin.github.io/luckykeno/) &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; A minimalist, provably fair Keno game.

---

Lucky Keno is a sleek, single-page web application that offers a modern and transparent Keno betting experience. Inspired by the principles of fairness and user control, this game is built with a focus on clean design and robust functionality.

## Features

- **Provably Fair Betting:** A transparent and verifiable betting system using a combination of a server seed, a client seed, and a nonce. The server seed is hashed and displayed before each game, and the full seed is revealed afterward, allowing for complete verification of every draw.
- **Classic Keno Gameplay:** Choose your lucky numbers from a board of 80. The game draws 20 numbers, and you win based on how many you match.
- **Adjustable Risk & Payout:** The payout multiplier updates in real-time based on how many numbers you choose to play.
- **Detailed Payout Table:** A clear and easy-to-understand table showing potential winnings for different numbers of matches.
- **Game History:** A detailed history of your recent games, including the drawn numbers, your picks, the result, payout, and the server seed for verification.
- **Sound & Animation:** Engaging animations and sound effects provide a satisfying and immersive user experience.

## Provably Fair System

The provably fair system ensures that neither the player nor the house can manipulate the outcome of a game. It works as follows:

1.  **Server Seed:** A random, secret seed is generated by the server.
2.  **Server Seed Hash:** The server seed is hashed using SHA-256 and shown to the player *before* the game starts.
3.  **Client Seed:** The player can provide their own seed. This ensures the house cannot pre-calculate outcomes based on a known seed.
4.  **Nonce:** A number that increments with each bet.

Before the game, the player has the server seed hash. After the game, the server seed is revealed. The player can then use a third-party tool or the game's own verification feature to check that the hash of the revealed server seed matches the one shown before the game, and that the combination of the server seed, client seed, and nonce produces the exact outcome.
