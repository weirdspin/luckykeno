# Lucky Keno

A minimalist, provably fair Lucky Keno game.

---

Lucky Keno is a sleek, single-page web application that offers a modern and transparent Lucky Keno betting experience. Inspired by the principles of fairness and user control, this game is built with a focus on clean design and robust functionality.

## Features

-   **Provably Fair Betting:** A transparent and verifiable betting system using a combination of a server seed, a client seed, and a nonce. The server seed is hashed and displayed before each round, and the full seed is revealed afterward, allowing for complete verification of every draw.
-   **Interactive Keno Board:** Select up to 10 numbers from a 40-tile grid.
-   **Adjustable Risk & Payout:** Choose between different risk levels (Low, Medium, High) to change the payout table, allowing you to tailor your betting strategy.
-   **Auto-Pick & Clear:** Use the "Auto Pick" feature for a quick random selection or "Clear Table" to start over.
-   **Game History:** A detailed history of your recent bets, including your selections, the drawn numbers, and the server seed for verification.
-   **Engaging Animations:** Satisfying animations for number selection and the reveal of winning numbers.

## Tech Stack

## Provably Fair System

The provably fair system ensures that neither the player nor the house can manipulate the outcome of a draw. It works as follows:

1.  **Server Seed:** A random, secret seed is generated by the server.
2.  **Server Seed Hash:** The server seed is hashed using SHA-256 and shown to the player *before* the bet.
3.  **Client Seed:** The player can provide their own seed. This ensures the house cannot pre-calculate outcomes based on a known seed.
4.  **Nonce:** A number that increments with each bet.

Before the round, the player has the server seed hash. After the round, the server seed is revealed. The player can then use a third-party tool or the game's own verification feature to check that the hash of the revealed server seed matches the one shown before the bet, and that the combination of the server seed, client seed, and nonce produces the exact set of drawn numbers.
